# Learning_R

I am starting to learn R and I am loving it :blue_heart:<br>
<br>
There are two directories here:<br>
- about my on-line classes at Summer Courses in IME (Maths and Statistics Institute) at SÃ£o Paulo University<br>
- about the tutorial 10 Days of Statistics in Hacker Rank solved in R<br>
